# React Native App

This folder will be home to all JavaScript code for the React Native App. 
Checkout the instructions below to get started.

### Setup

##### Node
Make sure you have `node` installed globally on your device. You can verify this by running the command `node --version`
which should give you the version of `node` you have installed. If you do not have node installed please follow the
instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Inside the `/client` directory terminal, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

#### Expo

`npm i -g expo-cli` to install the Expo command line interface

### Development

All the primary code should be in the `/src` folder.

#### Code style
Please make sure to run the commands below before committing your code to ensure consist code styling.

`npm run lint` to check for errors or warnings

`npm run lint:fix` to automatically fix some errors and/or warnings

### Running the app

`npm start` to launch expo on your browser

To run the app on a physical phone, download the `Expo Go` app from the iOS App Store or Google Play Store.

If you'd wish to run the app on an emulator instead follow the instructions 
[here for iOS](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) and 
[here for Andriod](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
