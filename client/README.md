`cd client` to change current directory.

### Setup

##### Node

Make sure you have `node` installed globally on your device. You can verify this by running the command `node --version`
which should give you the version of `node` you have installed. If you do not have node installed please follow the

Please make sure to run the commands below before committing your code to ensure consist code styling.

`npm run lint` to check for errors or warnings

`npm run lint:fix` to automatically fix some errors and/or warnings

### Running the app

`npm start` to launch expo on your browser

To run the app on a physical phone, download the `Expo Go` app from the iOS App Store or Google Play Store.

If you'd wish to run the app on an emulator instead follow the instructions
[here for iOS](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) and
